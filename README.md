### Introduction 

The "Recycle Bay Area" app is a waste management and recycling application that helps users locate the nearest recycling, donation, or CRV refund recycling locations.

Please keep in mind that this is still a draft, and I'm actively working on this project.

The website consists of four pages: a home page, a Recycle/Donate page, a Recycle Guide page, and the Redeem Beverage Containers page.

On the Home page, users can learn about this project or search for locations where they can recycle, donate, or redeem items.

If users scroll down, they will find three options available on this website:

Discover locations where they can donate or recycle items.
Learn how to recycle items properly.
Find locations to recycle beverage containers for a CRV refund.

Clicking on one of these images will navigate them to the relevant section, where they can enter their address when searching for the nearest locations for CRV refunds:

Or they can enter the name of the item they want to recycle or donate:

Currently, I'm actively working on the Redeem_Bev_Container page. Users can enter their address, and the nearest CRV locations will be displayed on the map, along with a list of those locations, commute times, and distances:
