## Introduction

I developed a waste management and recycling app to assist users in locating the nearest CRV centers, donation points, and recycling locations in the Bay Area. Utilizing CSS and Figma, I crafted a responsive interface to ensure compatibility across various devices. For storing information on the closest CRV centers, donation, and recycling locations, I implemented an SQLite database. To establish connectivity between ReactJS and the SQLite database, I utilized Node.js and Express.js.

Using React.js, Node.js, and JavaScript, I implemented features that enable location-based searches for nearby recycling, donation, or CRV centers.

## Functionality

Users can enter an address to locate the nearest CRV centers or search for items they want to donate or recycle, finding the closest recycling and donation points

Once users enter the name of the item they wish to donate or recycle, or their address to find the closest CRV locations, they will be redirected to the corresponding page. There, they can view a map displaying the user's location marked in red, while green markers represent the nearest recycling, donating, or CRV centers.

Additionally, a location table displays the nearest locations, estimated travel time, and distance.
